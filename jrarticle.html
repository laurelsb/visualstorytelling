   <p>Whenever Isidora Stella visits Northeastern University’s Office of Global Services, she knows she needs to make her requests simple and basic. As a fifth year economics major who moved to from Greece to study in Boston, Stella’s schedule is packed. With paperwork to fill, jobs to apply for, and schoolwork deadlines to meet, requesting help and resources from OGS should be the one thing in her life that’s seamless  — yet she finds the facility is no more helpful than the cold digital interface of their online resource hub.</p>

  <p>Boasting “professional expertise and support,” the services OGS provides often lack any expansion beyond what international students can access on their website. Though they provide rudimentary resources and links, they lack personalized consulting and support for students that are overwhelmed navigating their college years as both new students and young people in a foreign country. Stella said that students are largely on their own.</p>

   <p>“They won’t do that extra little mile, you know, to help you,” Stella said. “It’s like, they will just help you with a very basic process. But if it’s something that they can find on their website or on their notes, the people who work there don’t know anything more than that.”</p>

  <p>From the first time Stella stepped on campus she’s encountered a series of endless hoops and obstacles to overcome to figure out her post-graduate career path as an international student. She began her undergraduate education by majoring in politics, philosopy and economics, but immediately stumbled into a massive roadblock — she could only work for a single year in the United States after graduating as an F1-visa holder. After learning that her friend, a business administration and economics major  was eligible to work for three years as a STEM major, she hoped the economics portion of her degree would also help her qualify. But Stella said when she visited OGS seeking clarification and guidance, they were just as lost as she was.</p>

   <p>Without any administrative consensus, Stella was forced to change her major to the same one as her friend just to guarantee she’d have those three post-grad working years.</p>

   <p> The constant chaos within OGS partially stems from the staff they hire. Many OGS employees are international students themselves, who are only authorized that same maximum of one year of working outside of campus — including six-month co-op opportunities. Forced to conserve their time, off-campus jobs often aren’t an option for international students, restricting them to earning additional sources of income via employment at their university of choice. Stella believes that these conditions have transformed the office into a feedback loop of confused international students with more questions than answers.</p>

   <p>“The person you have direct contact with is some grad student that basically wants a job, and so they work at OGS because that’s the only place they can work on campus,” Stella said. “I feel like I already know what they know. I’ve never received any new knowledge, or something that they don’t know, or something that I didn’t already know from these people, because what they know is just on the website.”</p>

   <p>With the same unclear and detached information parroted back at them with each visit, international students often find their experiences with OGS lacking. Abandoned by their own institutions, they’re then forced to figure out employment paperwork, job applications, and other international student-specific tasks on their own — making the already disorienting nature of college life that much more daunting and confusing.</p>
