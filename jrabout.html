    <p> This is a project created by Laurel Booth, Diego Maldonado, Curtis DeSmith, Emi Chung, and Devin Lastname for JR2301: Visual Storytelling in Journalism.</p>
    <p> International students are an integral part of campus life. And yet, they face more stress and challenges than domestic students. University services are meant to address these obstacles but often fall short.</p>
      <p>This project is an investigation recollecting the experiences of international students' struggles when accessing their global services at their universities.</p>
